## Overview

![screenshot](img/captureDesktop.jpeg)

This website shows a recipe for Quesillo Venezolano, a delicious dessert from my country. 

In this project, Flexbox is used for the distribution of the elements on the screen for both Desktop and Mobile.

The challenge proposes the use of Checbox to keep track of the ingredients. The customization of custom CheckBoxes is highlighted to obtain uniformity in all browsers.
